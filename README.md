# 100 Days of Miva - API and Front-end Projects

![#100daysofMiva Banner](public/20240818_225416.png)

Welcome to my repository for the #100daysofMiva challenge! This repository contains a collection of 100 simple API projects developed over 100 days. The challenge is all about consistency, learning, and building resilience through daily coding.

## About the Challenge

The #100daysofMiva challenge is designed to help developers, especially students of Miva Open University, develop a strong work ethic by committing to coding every day. The goal is to spend at least one hour each day working on a small project, pushing the boundaries of our skills, and documenting our progress.
